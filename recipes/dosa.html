    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>A popular South Indian dish made from fermented rice and lentil batter, cooked until crispy and golden-brown.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup rice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup split black lentils (urad dal)</li>
        <li>Water (as needed)</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>Oil or ghee for cooking</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the rice and urad dal separately and soak them in water for about 4-6 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Drain the water and grind the rice and dal separately to a smooth paste using a little water as needed.</li>
        <li>Mix both the ground pastes together, add salt, and mix well. Let the batter ferment overnight or for about 8-10 hours.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or dosa pan over medium heat. Pour a ladleful of batter onto the center of the pan and spread it evenly in a circular motion to make a thin dosa.</li>
        <li>Drizzle some oil or ghee around the edges of the dosa and cook until the bottom turns golden-brown and crisp.</li>
        <li>Flip the dosa and cook the other side for a minute or until it turns light golden brown.</li>
        <li>Repeat the process with the remaining batter to make more dosas.</li>
        <li>Serve hot dosas with coconut chutney, sambar, or your favorite side dish.</li>
    </ol>
